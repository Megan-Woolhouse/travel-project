          <h3>WHY NEW YORK CITY?</h3>
          <h2>NYC, the city that never sleeps</h2>
          <p>
            There is something magical about New York City. From the hustle and
            bustle of Times Square to the iconic skyline, NYC is a city like no
            other. Whether you’re visiting for the first time or the hundredth
            time, it’s guaranteed to be an unforgettable experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people don't know or have forgotten that New York City,
            formerly named New Amsterdam, was the country's first official
            capital. As such, New York has sites of amazing historical value. Or
            if you're not into history, this modern city has a plethora of
            activities to fill your time. From broadway shows to bougie cafe's
            and bars, from stunning architechture to shopping till you drop, NYC
            has something for everyone.
