            <h2>NYC, the city that never sleeps</h2>
            <p>
              There is something magical about New York City. From the hustle
              and bustle of Times Square to the iconic skyline, NYC is a city
              like no other. Whether you’re visiting for the first time or the
              hundredth time, it’s guaranteed to be an unforgettable experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people don't know or have forgotten that New York City,
              formerly named New Amsterdam, was the country's first official
              capital. As such, New York has sites of amazing historical value.
              Or if you're not into history, this modern city has a plethora of
              activities to fill your time. From broadway shows to bougie cafe's
              and bars, from stunning architechture to shopping till you drop,
              NYC has something for everyone.
